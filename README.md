# simuEMmatlab
Simulator for calculating the electric field at a point generated by base stations using MATLAB.

The simulator calculates the electric field at a specific point generated by a base station,
considering multiple factors such as antenna patterns, transmission power, propagation models, 
and environmental conditions. It processes user-defined parameters, selects an appropriate propagation model (COST 231-Hata, ITU-R P.1238,
or with obstacle attenuation), and computes the resulting field strength in V/m and dB.
The tool enables analysis of electromagnetic exposure and signal propagation, providing a realistic estimation of the field distribution in urban, suburban, and rural environments.
